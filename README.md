# NeuroCAAS Contrib
# 

## A repository to assist the creation of new analysis pipelines on the NeuroCAAS platform. 
This repository contains tools for development and maintenance of analyses to be used through the NeuroCAAS platform. It allows developers to first build their analyses on a docker container hosted on their local machine, then gradually transition it for use via drag-and-drop data upload, hosted on the cloud. Please see the docs [here](https://neurocaas-contrib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction.html) for more info, and the source repository [here](https://github.com/cunningham-lab/neurocaas) for a full developer guide.
